Artificial Intelligence Based Art Gallery Mobile Application

## Project Description

users (if it is public) or it would be only shown for demonstration purposes on their galleries with their prompts given below for it to be a starting
point to the other users (if it is private). Depending on the userâ€™s choice, the app could also generate a story related to the provided prompt. Thanks to the applications user-friendly interface and environment, it targets a large audience.
