Artificial Intelligence Based Art Gallery Mobile Application

## Project Description

This mobile application aims to provide its users an environment to create and share their artificially generated artworks. The users would be able
to provide some prompts to the model and based on the keywords, the application would produce a unique art piece. Based on the user’s
preference they could either save the work to their profile, according to the visibility status, it could be observed and downloadable by the other
users (if it is public) or it would be only shown for demonstration purposes on their galleries with their prompts given below for it to be a starting
point to the other users (if it is private). Depending on the user’s choice, the app could also generate a story related to the provided prompt. In
addition, to get connected with other users, they could enroll in pre-existing groups or create a new one themselves, where they could discuss how
did they produce their artworks in detail. Thanks to the applications user-friendly interface and environment, it targets a large audience.
